# VideoGrapher
Literally takes a video and draws using the Desmos API.

I dunno, Bad Apple!!

## Status
Yeah, no.

## Usage
Start the generic Node server (or any static hosting server). Then navigate to the webpage. Click, and watch.
I did not include the 480x360 mp4 file of `bad_apple_pv.mp4` for obvious copyright reasons (and that it's a big file to put in GitHub).
Just find a copy (or another video of the same name) and plop that down in the static folder.

## Contribution
Please don't. Or do, if you really want to figure out how to graph Fourier epicircles because IDK how to do that *with Desmos*.

## License
There's like... barely any code here. Most of it is Desmos and OpenCV(.js), read their licenses. Since I have not modified their code (plus, it's fetched from their servers), plz don't sue me.
AFAIK Node.js and Express.js are also under the MIT license, see their repos since I also don't have their sources.

Here's mine.
